 * @file bbzneighbors.h
 * @brief Definition of the neighbors table, which is a table of all
 * robots a robot can communicate with.
 *
 * @details <h2>Explanation of the implementation:</h2>
 *
 * <h3>'Regular' implementation (non Xtreme):</h3>
 *
 * Both the <code>neighbors</code> table and the neighbor-like tables
 * (such as the one returned by the filter closure) have the same
 * implementation:
 * The table contains a subfield  (string __BBZSTRID_INTERNAL_1_DO_NOT_USE)
 * which itself contains one table for each neighbor.
 *
 * <h3>BBZ_XTREME_MEMORY implementation:</h3>
 *
 * Creating a table for each neighbor robot would be memory-expensive, because
 * a table segment would have to be allocated for each neighbor, even though
 * we only really need 5 bytes of data for each neighbor (robot ID,
 * distance, azimuth, elevation). Instead, the neighbors structure is
 * implemented as a C structure (see #bbzneighbors_elem_t).
 *
 * This, however, poses a problem : the algorithms ('foreach', 'get', etc.)
 * have to be compatible both with the 'neighbors' structure, which has C
 * implementation, and the nieghbor-like structures (such as
 * the table returned by neighbors.filter), which have a Buzz implementation.
 * The (ugly!) solution we have implemented is to keep the heap position
 * of the 'neighbors' table inside the VM, and then vary the algorithm
 * depending on whether we are working on the 'neighbors' table or a
 * neighbor-like table.
 *
 * We could have made two distinct set of algorithms, one for the 'nieghbors'
 * table, and one for the others, but this would have taken more program
 * space.
 *
 * Thus, we end up with the following implementation:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The <code>neighbors</code> table, apart from the closures, contains a
 * count subfield (string __BBZSTRID_INTERNAL_2_DO_NOT_USE). The actual
 * data is placed inside a C structure (a table of #bbzneighbors_elem_t).
 * <li> The neighbor-like tables, apart from the closures, contain a
 * count subfield (string __BBZSTRID_INTERNAL_2_DO_NOT_USE). The actual
 * data is placed directly inside the neighbor-like table, and is a table
 * containing the <code>{distance, azumuth, elevation}</code> subfields.
 * Thus, we <i>could</i> access the distance for a neighbor by doing
 * something like <code>neighborlike[32].distance</code>.
 * </ul>
