 * @brief Definition of swarms, which are collections of robots.
 * @details <h2>Explanation of the implementation:</h2>
 *
 * The swarm membership information for a robot (the "swarmlist") is
 * contained in a bitfield. See #bbzswarmlist_t for details.
 *
 * <h3>With swarmlist broadcasts:</h3>
 *
 * This configuration is required by the <code>neighbors.kin</code> and
 * <code>neighbors.nonkin</code> closures. However, these closures are
 * currently not implemented, thus <b>this configuration is currently not
 * supported</b> (but has been partly implemented). However, for future work
 * and for reference, here are some possible designs that were thought
 * of until it was realized that broadcasting swarmlists is not necessary:
 *
 * <h4>C implementation (BBZ_XTREME_MEMORY?)</h4>
 *
 * The swarmlists data would be stored in a C array. Each element would
 * contain the robot's ID (2B) and its swarmlist (1B), totalling for
 * 3B per entry.
 *
 * This had the advantage of taking very little RAM, but the number
 * of entries has a hard limit.
 *
 * <h4>Dynamic implementation (NON-BBZ_XTREME_MEMORY?)</h4>
 *
 * The swarmlists data would be stored directly inside the <code>swarm</code>
 * table, or in a subtable of it, like in the non-xtreme implementation
 * of the <code>neighbors</code> structure. The key of each entry
 * would be the robot's ID and the data would be the swarmlist of
 * that robot. This requires 10B in the heap for each entry:
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr><th>Object-side of the heap</th>       <td>robot ID object (3B)</td>   <td>swarmlist obj (3B)</td></tr>
 * <tr><th>Table segment-side of the heap</th><td>robot ID reference (2B)</td><td>swarmlist reference (2B)</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * Normally, the table segments are supposed to contain a reference
 * (#bbzheap_idx_t) to the key and the value, as the above table shows.
 * However, assuming no user will try to access the fields, we could
 * "cheat" this down to 4B:
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr><th>Table segment-side of the heap</th><td>robot ID (2B)</td><td>swarmlist (2B)</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * Beware that only the 15 least least significant bits of the
 * robot's ID as well as the swarmlist could be used at that point.
 *
 * This method has the advantage of being dynamic, meaning the data table
 * will become larger when we need more entries and might shrink when
 * we release entries. Also, we could be able to increase the swarmlist to
 * 2B at this point without any extra heap usage, since heap-allocated
 * objects always have 2B of payload data anyway. However, it takes more
 * RAM space compared to the C implementation, and the last cheat we
 * propose kinda breaks the engineering.
 *
 * <h4>Note</h4>
 *
 * The 'regular' Buzz also has an 'age' field to tell since how long
 * we haven't received any update for the swarmlist of a neighbor robot.
 * It is used to remove entries that we haven't had an update for for a
 * while. It would be possible to use this inside BittyBuzz too,
 * however we can work without it. This could be done by synchronizing
 * the <code>neighbors</code> structure with the <code>swarm</code>
 * structure in such a way that removing the swarmlist entry for
 * <code>swarm</code> is done at the same time as we remove the neighbor
 * for <code>neighbors</code>. The downside at that point is that we would
 * always need the 'neighbors' structure to be enabled when we use swarm
 * broadcasts.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Without swarmlist broadcasts</h3>
 *
 * Since we don't share swarmlists, we only have our own swarmlist,
 * which is a 1B value. It is available under
 * <code>vm->swarm.my_swarmlist</code>, however users are expected not to
 * use this value, but use bbzswarm_isrobotin() instead.
